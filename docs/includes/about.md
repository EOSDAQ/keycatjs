# What is Keycat? [](#keycat)
Keycat is a browser-based wallet, supported by the *Keychain technology. Once inserted in the very beginning, private key is encrypted and stored in the browser. Therefore, Scatter is no longer needed.

_*Keychain: Major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and OS providers (Apple, Google) offer a security technology called Keychain. When you try to access a website or email account, you may have seen an pop-up option to save your password in the browser (usually, the pop-up shows up on the top right corner of the browser.) Here, the Keychain technology is used for storing your password (private key) in the browser._

# Why Keycat? [](#concept)
1. **Minimized login process (without Scatter)**

  To access an EOS-based DApp through Scatter on web, you need to go through the following steps:
    1. Download Scatter
    2. Import EOS account to Scatter
    3. Activate Scatter
    4. Visit DApp's website
    5. Login
  
  However, with Keycat, you can log in with minimized steps:
    1. Import EOS account at DApp's website
    2. Login
  
2. **Top security level**

  Your data (EOS account and private key) is securely encrypted and stored in the browser. No one else can access or read this data, either in transit or storage. Thus, the security level is equivalent to major browser providers like Google (for Chrome) or Apple (for Safari).

3. **Sync across multiple devices**

  Once saved in the browser, your date is encrypted and synced across all devices through your Google account or iCloud account. For example, after you save data in your web browser on desktop, you will also be able to access through the same browser on your mobile.

2. **How does Keychain protect my private key?**

  Keychain protects your information with end-to-end encryption, which provides the highest level of data security. Your data is protected with a key that's made from information unique to your device, and combined with your device passcode, which only you know. No one else can access or read this data, either in transit or storage.

3. **Is {{APP}} safe?**

  Yes. {{APP}} never and ever save your private key in a database. Everything is saved in Browser's keychain. {{APP}} cannot remove or update your Keychain-synced data. It is protected by browser itself. In other words, it is protected by Google or Apple, Firefox's security system.
